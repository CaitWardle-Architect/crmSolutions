# Feature: ISO-8601 Date Splitter

## Use Case: HubSpot date stamps provide full ISO string. In order to cascade historical account renewals to the correct month, 
requirement to focus on only month part, regardless of day/year in order to plan work throughout the year and not front-load bulk 
renewals to a single month.

## Solution: Workflow leveraging Data Operations Hub and custom formula to populate new property.

## The Logic
**Property Created:** `Contract Expiry _ Month` (Single-line text)

**Workflow Architecture:**
* **Enrollment Trigger:** `[Contract Expiry Date]` is known.
* **Action 1 (Format Data):** * **Custom Formula:** `format_datetime([enrolled_object.current_contract_expiry_date],"MMMM")`
* **Action 2:** Copy the output of Action 1 to `[enrolled_object.contract_expiry___month]`.

## Usage
A custom Deals view is created. 
Filters: `[contract_expiry___month]` is *month of interest* AND `[deal_owner]` is `[me]` AND `[pipeline] is any of [3__account_management_pipeline] AND [deal_stage] is none of [closed_won] or [closed_lost]. 
Columns: include `[product___expanded_]`, `[annual_contract_value]` and `[price_uplift_round]`
Action: Key Account Partners to work through every Deal displaying in their list for that month. 
If a renewal opportunity is present, Key Account Partner to create Renewal Deal in Opportunity Pipeline.
If there is no renewal opportunity present, Key Account Partner is to create a task for the future, when opportunity is present.
Maintenance: The [contract_expiry___month] filter is updated monthly by CRM Operations or the Commercial Sales Director to align with the current rolling forecast.
